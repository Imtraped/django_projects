A basic djnago project. However I'm doing something right! I'm on the right track.

## Get SCSS Working

### Mac

```bash
pip install libsass django-compressor django-sass-processor
```

### Windows

```bash
py -3 pip install libsass django-compressor django-sass-processor
```

## Windows Cmd

```workon``` is the command used to activate the virtual envroinment.

```deactivate``` is the command to stop your work.

Also, ```python3``` is replaced with ```py -3``` in here.
